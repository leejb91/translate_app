## the Translate Application

HONE stems from the issue of sending a refined email or any written correspondence in a language that is not the users' primary language. The users might be able to utilize Google Translate for a single word or phrase but not expect the application to gurgitate a polished paragraph with perfect grammar. There are always going to be issues with these translation services unless the translation is done by a real human being. That said, HONE crowd-sources the translations by allowing users to upload a post that they would like translated. Then other users who are experienced in that specified language can reply to the post with a refined paragraph. The application will support a community of multi-linguists where learning and language exchange is encouraged.

You will be able to the post that needs translating as well as all the other responses and a form to submit your own translation.

## Going Forward

After building a solid community with the free application service, there will be a good opportunity to monetize the website by allowing translators to charge for lengthier and more complex posts.

Other features that would be incorporated would include the following:

* voting system to display the best translations at the top
* favorite button for the poster to choose the best response
* after a response has been favorited, the post will be shown as "answered"
